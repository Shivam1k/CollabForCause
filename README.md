# 🚀 CollabForCause

> A digital collaboration platform connecting nonprofits with skilled volunteers for impactful social change.

## 📌 Problem Statement

**Problem Statement 10 – Rethink How Nonprofits Operate Digitally**

Nonprofits often struggle to manage and engage remote volunteers effectively. They lack tools to post actionable microtasks, assign roles, communicate asynchronously, and track contributions transparently. Volunteers also find it hard to discover verified tasks that match their skills and availability.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build a platform that connects NGOs and digital volunteers. The platform allows NGOs to post projects and microtasks, while volunteers can claim, contribute, and track their impact—all in one place.

### Target Users:
- Nonprofits and NGOs (project creators)
- Volunteers and professionals (task doers)
